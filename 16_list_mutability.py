Q1. Design a function that will take a list of integers and
changes the first element in the given list to its negated value.
ie. if the first value is 8, change it to -8,
if the first value is -2 change it to 2.
'''


'''
Q2. Design a function that will take a list of integers and
adds one to every element in the given list.
'''


'''
Q3a. Design a function that will take a list of integers and change
every value in that list to its absolute value
DO not use the built in abs function.

Q3b. Design a second version of this function that does use the built-in abs function
'''


'''
Q4. Design a function that takes a list of integers and an
additional integer.  The function should determine whether the
additional number is contained in the list.
Do not use the builtin in operator.
'''


'''
Q5. Design a function that takes a list of integers and an additional integer as second argument.
The function subtracts the integer from every value in the list.
If the subtraction results in a value below 0,
the element at that position should be set to 0.
